# BERT pretrain for KGAT

The bert pre-trained codes for KGAT

## Introduction
* The fact verification contains three steps: Document Retrieval, Sentence Retrival and Fact Verification
* We utilize claim evidence pair for BERT pre-train (Same codes for ''BERT + Prediction'' in ''retrieval_model'')



## Train a new sentence selection model
* Train the retrieval model
	* Run ''bash train.sh'' to pre-train the BERT model

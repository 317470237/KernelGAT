# BERT pretrain for KGAT

The bert pre-trained codes for KGAT.

## Introduction
* The fact verification shared task contains three steps: Document Retrieval, Sentence Retrival and Fact Verification.
* We utilize claim-evidence pairs to pre-train BERT (Same codes of ``BERT + Prediction`` in ``retrieval_model``).


## Pre-train BERT for fact verification
* Pre-train the BERT model:
	* Run ``bash train.sh`` to pre-train the BERT model.
